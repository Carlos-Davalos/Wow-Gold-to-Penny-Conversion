This WebPage is designed to give the gold value of each penny and dollar in World of Warcraft for each WOW Token when You buy with gold or money.
6 pages: Buying Wow token with Gold Conversion, Buying Wow Token with Real Money Conversion, Diablo Immortal Item Value, Legit Play to Earn Apps, Investment Analyses and Contact/follow/subscribe page.
Gold being the Main Page, Real money conversion being the 2nd, and the latter being the 3rd webpage. 

1st page(index) and 2nd page-Leaving the number open to have any input depending on the actual WOW Token Price by user ensures availability of the conversion available
to anyone in the world, instead of calculating for each region and using up more code that might slow down the site. That way
it's Universal. 
*updated: i added the value of your own gold conversion button under the initial gold to penny/dollar conversion. it is based on the
Wow token gold price that is input in the 1st field thereby whatever the wow token price is you can get a calculation on how much your total gold is actually worth.

DIIV page - Diablo immortal Item value page where you can find simple straightforward value of in-game items aswell as tips, and video reviews of in-game shop items value

Legit Play to Earn apps page - This page holds a few reviews of hidden gems(apps/games) not known to everyone that can generate a bit of side income. 

Investment Analyses page - This page has a few review/analyses videos/shorts from youtube that I handcrafted so you can have a bit of my analytical perspective and information.(*Not Financial Advice, I am not a Financial Advisor or am i qualified.)
