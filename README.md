This WebPage is designed to give the gold value of each penny and dollar in World of Warcraft for each WOW Token when You buy with gold or money.
3 pages: Buying Wow token with Gold Conversion, Buying Wow Token with Real Money Conversion, and Contact/follow/subscribe page.
Gold being the Main Page, Real money conversion being the 2nd, and the latter being the 3rd webpage. 

-Leaving the number open to have any input depending on the actual WOW Token Price by user ensures availability of the conversion available
to anyone in the world, instead of calculating for each region and using up more code that might slow down the site. That way
it's Universal. 
*updated: i added the value of your own gold conversion button under the initial gold to penny/dollar conversion. it is based on the
Wow token gold price that is input in the 1st field thereby whatever the wow token price is you can get a calculation on how much your total gold is actually worth.
